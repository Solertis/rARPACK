Description: rarpack is an R wrapper of the ARPACK library
    (http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/) to solve large scale eigen
    value/vector problems. It is typically used to compute a few eigen
    values/vectors of an n by n matrix, e.g., the k largest eigen values, which
    is usually more efficient than eigen() if k << n. Currently this package
    provides the function eigs() which does the similar job as in Matlab and
    Octave.
